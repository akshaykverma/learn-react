# Custom React - Understanding React Internals

## 🎯 Project Overview
A minimal implementation of React's core functionality to understand how React works under the hood.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### React Element Structure
- React elements are plain JavaScript objects
- Contains `type`, `props`, and `children` properties
- Virtual DOM representation of actual DOM elements

### Custom Render Function
- Mimics React's reconciliation process
- Creates DOM elements from React element objects
- Sets properties and handles children recursively

## 📝 What You'll Learn

- **Virtual DOM Concept**: How React represents UI as JavaScript objects
- **Element Creation**: Structure of React elements
- **Rendering Process**: How virtual DOM becomes real DOM
- **Props Handling**: How properties are passed and applied
- **React Internals**: Foundation concepts behind React's magic

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Check browser console for element structure
3. Examine `customreact.js` to understand the render logic

## 💡 Important Notes

- This is a simplified version - real React is much more complex
- Demonstrates core concepts without optimizations
- Foundation for understanding React's reconciliation algorithm
